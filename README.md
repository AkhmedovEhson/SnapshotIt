`Snapshot It` is mini-library(utils) to make coding more easy. There are some moments when you update state of class and can not to recovery the previous state, here comes `Snapshot It`.

üñäÔ∏è We have a class `Product` (?)
```
public class Product
{
    public int Id {get;set}
    public string Name{get;set;}
}
```
üêπ Let's do following steps....
```
var product = new Product() 
{
    Id = 1
    Name = "Nike"
}
var snapshots = new Snaps(product);
product.Id = 2;
product.Name = "Gucci";

// gets the last snapshot
product = snapshots.Get(); 

// Logs: The product's name is Gucci
log.Information($"The product's name is {product.Name}");

// Logs: The previous product's name was Nike 
log.Information($"The previous product's name was {snapshots.Get().Value.Name}");
```
