# SnapshotIt
🎉 Snapshot It 1.0.0. Before changing the state of component, just snapshot the state of object to make it easy to recovery.

# Requirements
* .NET 6 🔒️ .NET 7 

# Documentation
💚 `Snapshot It` is extensionable lightweight-library, provides bunch of extensions.
<ul>
    <li>📝 Snapshotting - simply snapshot any instance in any context of application, and use it in runtime of application.</li>
    <li>🗃️ Copying - copy any instance.</li>
    <li>🌐 Channel `BufferBlock<T>` - use it as unbounded channel, post, read, close.</li>
</ul>

🖊️ We have a class `Product` (?)
```
public class Product
{
    public int Id {get;set}
    public string Name{get;set;}
}

// Copy class
var product = new Product() { Id = 1,Name = "Product" } // note, it is reference type and mutable
var product2 = Snapshot.Out.Copy(product); // copies `product`
```
🐹 Let's do following steps....
```
using SnapshotIt;

var product = new Product() 
{
    Id = 1
    Name = "Nike"
}
Snapshot.Out.Create<Product>(10); // initialized collection of `Product` with size `10`
Snapshot.Out.Post<Product>(product); // captures state

product.Id = 2;
product.Name = "Gucci";

const int index = 0;
// Gets the first snapshot from capture collection
// By default index = 0, using index easily can find the correct captured instance
var Capturedproduct = Snapshot.Out.Get<Product>(index); or use expressions Snapshot.Out.Get(o => o.Id == n);


// Logs: The product's name is Gucci
log.Information($"The product's name is {product.Name}");

// Logs: The previous product's name was Nike 
log.Information($"The previous product's name was {Capturedproduct.Name}");
```
💚 ASP.NET and Dependency Injections
```
using SnapshotIt.DependencyInjection;

// Actually for injecting stuff into class, you are injecting from $constructor
public class UserController : BaseController
{
    public ILogger logger;
    public UserController(ILogger logger) 
    {
        this.logger = logger;
    }
}

// You can communicate with DI container very easy </>
// Use following steps ...
public class UserController : BaseController
{
    public ILogger logger = Connector.GetService<ILogger>(); // you got it :)
}
```
🎨 Registration of services.
```
using SnapshotIt.DependencyInjection;
// NOTE: `SnapshotIt` looks for it's interface by [NAME] e.g. there is Product, it's interface must be `IProduct` !!!
public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository,IScoped{} // Interface `IScoped` pushes it as Scoped lifetime to dep. injection container. 
public class ColorRepository : IColorRepository, ITransient{} // Interface `ITransient` pushes it as Transient lifetime to dep. injection container. 

var RuntimeServicesRegisterExecutor = new RuntimeRegisterServices(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), services);
RuntimeServicesRegisterExecutor.ConfigureScopedServices(); // looks for all classes impl. IScoped
RuntimeServicesRegisterExecutor.ConfigureTransientServices(); // looks for all classes impl. ITransient
```
